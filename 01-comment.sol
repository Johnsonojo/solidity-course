        I'm learning solidity programming so that I can be skilled enough to take advantage of the various opportunity in the 
        the DeFi space. I believe that by the power, grace and wisdom of God, I will achieve my goal of becoming highly proficient
        in the solidity programming language

        I have made up my mind to commit to this on a daily basis irrespective of my schedule.
