pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;
// This means we're specifying the compiler version of solidity ranging from and including 0.7.0 up to but excluding 0.9.0

// Pragma is a keyword that tells the compiler which version of solidity we are using
// It is important to specify the version of solidity we are using because the compiler will use the latest version of solidity by default if we don't specify the version we are using and this can lead to unexpected behaviour.

// The pragma keyword is followed by the version of solidity we are using and the version of solidity we are using is followed by a semicolon
